# ECOBOT
setup for a Facebook Messenger BOT.
This project contains so far the implementation for a messenger bot from "scratch"
Handles messages and does the http request to server.
The bot is hosted on heroku deploying the main code there.
Here is handled the webhook.

So far the bot displays specific information and has no autonomy, it's just pre-processed answer to specific queries.

The next steps involve the NLP integration using wit.ai and more NLP functions to be investigated on internet from different sources.
